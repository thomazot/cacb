# Application

The application consists of one file, `application.sass`, and it acts as the loader file for **MVCSS**. The file consists of imports and the inbox.

## Imports

- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) (optional, see below)
- [Core](/core/)
- [Modules](/modules/)

**Note**: [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) provides utilities and niceties to make your life easier. We use it, and we recommend that you give it a try.

## Inbox

The inbox allows developers, and those not actively working on the CSS, to quickly add styles that are easily seen by the maintainer of the file. This section of the Application has worked wonders for us.
