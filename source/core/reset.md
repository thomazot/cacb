# Reset / Normalize

As long as the project size warrants it, we always get things started with a style reset. [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is what we use, but alternatives like the infamous [Eric Meyer Reset CSS](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) are easily interchangeable.

With **Normalize.css**, we recommend that you alter it on a per-project basis, and make the proper overrides in [**Core - Base**](/core/base/).
